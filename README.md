### 📖 About The Project

As we continue from the **KitaBUDDY:#JOMCEGAHBULI** and **S.A.F.E Kiosk Project**, we are proud to introduce the Progressive Web App (PWA) version of S.A.F.E!

S.A.F.E is an advanced reporting platform designed to foster a safer school environment. It provides a secure, confidential, and easily accessible channel for students and staff to report any incident, bullying, or emergency without fear of reprisal.

Being a **PWA**, S.A.F.E is instantly accessible from any web browser on a smartphone or computer—no app store download required.

### 🚀 Key Features

The system is split into two main components: the public reporting interface for students and a comprehensive management dashboard for administrators.

#### For Reporters (Students)
* **🛡️ Anonymous Reporting:** Submit reports with the full confidence that your identity is protected.
* ** multimedia Submissions:** Users can describe incidents in the way that suits them best, with support for **Text**, **Audio**, and **Video** reports.
