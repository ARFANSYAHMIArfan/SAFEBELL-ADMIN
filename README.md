### 📖 About The Project

As we continue from the **KitaBUDDY:#JOMCEGAHBULI** and **S.A.F.E Kiosk Project**, we are proud to introduce the Progressive Web App (PWA) version of S.A.F.E!

S.A.F.E is an advanced reporting platform designed to foster a safer school environment. It provides a secure, confidential, and easily accessible channel for students and staff to report any incident, bullying, or emergency without fear of reprisal.

Being a **PWA**, S.A.F.E is instantly accessible from any web browser on a smartphone or computer—no app store download required.

### 🚀 Key Features

The system is split into two main components: the public reporting interface for students and a comprehensive management dashboard for administrators.

#### For Reporters (Students)
* **🛡️ Anonymous Reporting:** Submit reports with the full confidence that your identity is protected.
* ** multimedia Submissions:** Users can describe incidents in the way that suits them best, with support for **Text**, **Audio**, and **Video** reports.
* **📱 Instant PWA Access:** The platform can be accessed instantly from any device with a web browser, ensuring the barrier to reporting is as low as possible.

#### For Admins (Teachers & Staff)
* **🔒 Secure Admin Login:** A dedicated portal for authorized personnel to manage the system.
* **📊 Centralized Dashboard:** A "Papan Pemuka" (Dashboard) to view, manage, and archive all incoming reports. This includes separate tabs for "Urus Laporan Teks" (Manage Text Reports), "Arkib Media" (Media Archive), and "Tetapan" (Settings).
* **🔧 Full System Control:**
    * **Disable Reporting Form:** Ability to temporarily "Lumpuhkan Borang Laporan" (Disable Report Form) for all users.
    * **Maintenance Mode:** Activate a "Kunci Penyelenggaraan" (Maintenance Lock) secured by an 8-Digit PIN.
* **📦 Data Portability:**
    * **Export Data:** Securely download all report records as a JSON file.
    * **Import Data:** Upload a JSON file to restore or transfer report data.
* **🩺 System Status & Debugging:**
    * **Live API Monitoring:** Real-time status checks for all critical API connections (Firebase, Telegram, Cerebras, OpenAI).
    * **Permission Checks:** Verifies that browser permissions for Camera, Microphone, and Location are correctly configured.
